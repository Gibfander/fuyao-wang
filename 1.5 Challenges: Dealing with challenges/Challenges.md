In week1, I felt a little overwhelmed since my English is not good. 
I can hear the tutor's words clearly while I cannot hear every word when I was in a group.
The reasn is that I cannot distinguish what everyone is speaking when English at the same time and I can also hear the voice from the table that next me.
